# `react-native-image-utils` example

This is a very simple example app, loading the first photo from the device camera roll
and allowing to resize it.

## Installation

Be sure to have React Native installed.

```bash
cd example
yarn #or npm install
```

### iOS

```
react-native run-ios
```

### Android

```
react-native run-android
```

## Development

If you want to use this sample app to develop `react-native-image-utils`, erase the `node_modules/react-native-image-utils` folder and replace it by the git repository:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/react-native-image-utils
cd node_modules && git clone git@github.com:appfolio/react-native-image-utils.git
```

Recompile and relaunch iOS/Android apps.
